# Rosetta 3-0 Decklists Analysis

This branch contains data from the old F&B expansion. This means that this data is no longer accessible on the web page. If you want to view this data, please visit [Accessibility](#accessibility).

## Accessibility

### Compatibility with Newer Versions

If you want to run the newest `create_card_data.py` file, then be aware that the FaBrary export format has changed, so:

- You should either update the parsing logic in the main branch to match the Rosetta script  
**or**
- Ideally, write a converter that updates old-format exports to the new format  
**(or wait till I have enough time and energy to do so)**

### Access the version before release of Rosetta

If you are interested in the data but not in the analysis, you can either **clone** this repository or simply **download** what you need from the `data` folder (and potentially the `scripts` folder).

If you want to access the old data, you should do so by using web interface (As viewing the raw HTML file is not very useful)
1. **Clone** the repository or **download** `index.html` and the `docs` folder.
2. Navigate to the folder containing `index.html`. Ensure that the `docs` folder is inside it.
3. Create a local server in this folder. There are multiple ways to do this. I'm using `py -m http.server` (only if you have Python installed), but you can also use `Simple Web Server`, `Simple HTTP Server`, or even the Chrome extension `Web Server for Chrome`.
4. Navigate to the URL of your server at `/index.html`. (For Python method: If you see the message: `Serving HTTP on :: port 8000`, then go to `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.)
5. Now you have access to the final version of Rosetta before the switch to The Hunted.

**Note:** You should be able to view HTML pages in a browser without a local server, but `vis.html` will not load correctly.

2. **HERO_total_count**: The total count of the card in HERO decks  -> HERO_total_count  
3. **draft_average_occurrence**: The average occurrence of the card in one draft.  
4. **pick_rate**: `All Cards / (Draft Average Occurrence * Number_of_decks)`  
5. **HERO_pick_rate**: `HERO Cards / (Draft Average Occurrence * Number_of_HERO_decks)`

10. **HERO_average_count_per_normalized_deck**: Similar to above but only for HERO decks
