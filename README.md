## Information
Rosetta draft data are out. You can check them out [HERE](https://petr7410.github.io/fab-3-0-decklists-analysis) thanks to the GitHub Pages.  

I step out of generating markdown files, it is possible, but I don't think it is that much useful.  

I'm planning to:
 - Include tutorial how to access the PtM draft data
 - Finish working on the main branch
 - Improve this readme
