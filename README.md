## Information
I apologize for the hard reset of this repository, but it was the most efficient way to reorganize everything and prepare for future updates.

Currently, I'm making preparations for **Rosetta**, so once I have access to new data, everything will be set up to run smoothly.

### What's Changed?
- **For Page Users**: Nothing will change for those who are only using the HTML page. It will continue to function as expected.
- **For Repo Users**: The files related to PtM can now be found in the `PtM` branch.

### What to Expect Going Forward:
- **Expansions**: Each expansion will now be in its own branch.
- **HTML Page**: The HTML page will only contain data from the latest expansion. You will still be able to access previous expansions, but only through the repository.
- **Main Branch**: The `main` branch will now contain a universal scripts. After setting up the initialization file and providing your own data, you'll be able to generate your own HTML page.

### Ongoing Work:
I'm currently reworking my scripts so that the `main` branch can fulfill its new role. I aim to complete this before we begin with the **Rosetta** draft.
